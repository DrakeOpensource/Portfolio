#### Hello and welcome to my GitHub!

The `Data Science Skill Portfolio` folder contains various skill categories
and subcategories (e.g. `Machine Learning/K-Nearest Neighbors`) with projects for each.

Each terminating folder contains a full project in an easy to digest format (jupyter notebook).
 Additionally, each project folder contains a `pdf` of each project with full outputs and bookmarked sections.
